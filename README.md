A blog using Symfony's API Platform and React JS


i'm just adding whatever as I go, the goal is to master using API platform and react JS,


but...


for now i know that i want users, posts and comments.

and a dashboard which isn't that important for me, I might stick with EASYADMIN.

how to try this ?

0/ `cd [location]/blog/`

1/ `composer install`

2/ `symfony server:start` (if u have the symfony-cli if not use your php server of choice by locating the public folder)

3/ `php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load -q` (to load the data)

4/ u can try the api using Postman or similar tools (via ur navigator visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ to learn more)

to be continued...
